# Folder structures

In this report im showing my folder structure for the courses Data analysis using R part 2, and the course workflows. These courses are from a data science for biology track I have followed. 


```{r loading libraries and figures, message = F}
library(png)
library(grid)
library(gridExtra)
library(here)

# I have used the fs package for creating these figures, in particular the dir_tree() function.
daur2_fs <- rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG(here("Figures/DAUR2_fs.png"))))
workflows_fs <-  rasterGrob(as.raster(readPNG(here("Figures/workflows_fs_.png"))))
```


## Folder structure of DAUR2:
```{r}
grid.arrange(daur2_fs)
```


## Folder structure of workflows (at time of making folder structure):
```{r}
grid.arrange(workflows_fs)
```
