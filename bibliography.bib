  abstract = {Using fast digestive proteins is of major interest to overcome ‘anabolic resistance’ of aging for limiting sarcopenia. Fast proteins’ action on muscle anabolism may be stimulated by other nutrients like vitamin D or omega 3 fatty acids or by combination with exercise. The beneficial impact of the ‘fast’ protein concept beyond the amount of dietary protein on muscle preservation is a promising therapeutic perspective to improve mobility and quality of life of older patients affected with chronic disease.},

  abstract = {Background \& aims: It has been suggested that anabolic resistance, or a blunted protein synthetic response to anabolic stimuli, contributes to the failure of muscle mass maintenance in older adults. The amino acid leucine is one of the most prominent food-related anabolic stimuli. However, data on muscle protein synthesis (MPS) after administration of a single bolus of leucine in aged populations is lacking and long-term single leucine supplementation has not been shown to increase muscle mass. This study aimed to determine the MPS response to the administration of a single bolus of leucine or to leucine combined with whey protein, in aged mice. Methods: Overnight fasted C57/BL6RJ mice at 25-mo of age received an oral gavage with leucine or whey-protein enriched with leucine (0.75 g/kg bodyweight total leucine in both) or 0.5 mL water (fasted control). Subsequently, mice were s.c. injected with puromycin (0.04 mmol/g bw at t ¼ 30, 45 or 60 min) and were sacrificed 30 min thereafter. Amino acid concentrations were determined in plasma and right muscle tibialis anterior (TA). Left TA was used to analyse MPS by SUnSET method and phosphorylation rate of Akt, 4E-BP1 and p70S6k by western blot. Results: In aged mice, leucine administration failed to increase MPS, despite a 6-fold increase in plasma leucine and elevated muscle free leucine levels (P {$<$} 0.05). In contrast, leucine-enriched whey protein significantly stimulated MPS in aged mice at 60 min after gavage (P {$<$} 0.05). Muscle free EAA, NEAA and the phosphorylation rate of Akt, 4E-BP1 and p70S6k increased significantly (P {$<$} 0.05), only after administration of leucine-enriched whey protein. Conclusions: MPS is stimulated in aged mice by leucine-enriched whey protein but not by leucine administration only. Administration of other amino acids may be required for leucine administration to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in aged mice.},

  abstract = {Antioxidant (AOX) deficiencies are commonly observed in older adults and oxidative stress has been suggested to contribute to sarcopenia. Here we investigate if 1) low levels of dietary antioxidants had a negative impact on parameters of muscle mass, function and quality, and 2) to study if nutritional interventions with AOX and/ or leucine-enriched whey protein could improve these muscle parameters in aged mice. 18-months-old mice were fed a casein-based antioxidant-deficient (lowox) diet or a casein-based control-diet (CTRL) for 7 months. During the last 3 months, lowoxmice were subjected to either: a) continued lowox, b) supplementation with vitamin A/E, Selenium and Zinc (AOX), c) substitution of casein with leucine-enriched whey protein (PROT) or d) a combination of both AOX and PROT (TOTAL). After 7 months lowox-mice displayed lower muscle strength and more muscle fatigue compared to CTRL. Compared to lowox-mice, PROT-mice showed improved muscle power, grip strength and less muscle fatigue. AOX-mice showed improved oxidative status, less muscle fatigue, improved grip strength and mitochondrial dynamics compared to lowox-mice. The TOTAL-mice showed the combined effects of both interventions compared to lowox-mice. In conclusion, nutritional intervention with AOX and/or leucine-enriched whey protein can play a role in improving muscle health in a AOXdeficient mouse model.},
