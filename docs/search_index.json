This report is for showing my skills in R that I have acquired during courses in a data science for biology track. To start off, I am loading the libraries that are used and reading the excel data into R. # Loading libraries library(tidyverse) library(readxl) library(here) # Reading data into R data &lt;- read_excel(here(path = &quot;Data/CE.LIQ.FLOW.062_Tidydata.xlsx&quot;)) # Checking datatypes and variables. str(data) After checking the datatypes of variables RawData, compName and compConcentration, these have numeric, character and again character as datatypes respectively. compConcentration should be numeric, or the plot would look like this: data %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = compConcentration, y = RawData, colour = compName, shape = expType)) + geom_point() + theme_bw() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) Because variable compConcentration is of character datatype, it is not plotted in the correct order. # Changing datatypes data$compName &lt;- as.factor(data$compName) data$compConcentration &lt;- as.numeric(data$compConcentration) # Making data a bit more readable by selecting fewer columns data2 &lt;- data %&gt;% select(vialNr, dropCode, expType, expReplicate, RawData, compName, compConcentration, compUnit, compVehicle) # Log10 of compConcentration and adding geom_jitter + geom_smooth to make plot more readable. data2 %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log10(compConcentration), y = RawData, colour = compName, shape = expType)) + theme_bw() + geom_jitter(width = 0.2) + labs(title = &quot;Offspring C. elegans after incubation with decane, napthalene, \\n2,6-diisopropylnapthalene, S-medium or ethanol&quot;, x = &quot;Log10 concentration component&quot;, y = &quot;Offspring amount&quot;) Compared to the previous plot, here the variable compConcentration is converted to numeric (and also taken the log10 of). Geom_jitter is also used so datapoints don’t overlap too much. The positive control in this experiment is ethanol, and the negative control is S-medium # Take the average offspring per compound, per concentration summary_data &lt;- data2 %&gt;% group_by(compName, compConcentration,expType) %&gt;% summarise(gem = mean(RawData, na.rm = T)) # Take the average offspring count of the negative control nc_gem &lt;- summary_data$gem[summary_data$expType == &quot;controlNegative&quot;] # Make a new column with normalised data, normalised by taking the fraction relative to the negative control, where the nc equals 1.0 summary_data &lt;- summary_data %&gt;% mutate(fractie = gem/nc_gem) # Filtering out positive/negative controls, so they don&#39;t show up in the plot. summary_plotting &lt;- summary_data %&gt;% filter(compName == &quot;decane&quot; | compName == &quot;2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot; | compName == &quot;naphthalene&quot;) summary_plotting %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = log10(compConcentration), y = fractie, colour = compName)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme_bw() + ylim(0,1.3) + labs(title = &quot;Offspring C. elegans after treatment with decane, napthalene \\nor 2,6-diisopropylnaphthalene&quot;, x = &quot;Log10 component concentration&quot;, y = &quot;Fraction offspring (relative to, negative control)&quot;) + guides(color = guide_legend(&quot;Component&quot;)) + scale_colour_manual(values = c(&quot;red&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;darkgreen&quot;)) In this plot the data is normalised relative to the negative control (S-medium), where offspring originating from C. elegans incubated in S-medium are equal to 1.0 Normalisation is done so the different compounds could be easily compared to the negative control, for which we know shouldn’t have an effect on offspring. If we would look at if there is an actual statistical significant difference in offspring count for the different compound incubations, we would perform the following steps: 1: Shapiro wilk test on the different groups, to see if the data is normally distributed 2: If the data is normally distributed, also perform a Levene’s test, because the experimental design is unpaired. 3: Then perform unpaired T-tests. "],["transparency-criteria.html", "3 Transparency criteria", " 3 Transparency criteria In this report I am doing an open peer review of a scientific paper by filling in transparency criteria, I am also reproducing a plot in a paper to test reproducibility of the code. This is the first article I have chosen: Article: Epidemiological and evolutionary consequences of different types of CRISPR-Cas systems Authors: Hélène Chabas, Viktor Müller, Sebastian Bonhoeffer and Roland R. Regoes The general aim of this study was to determine the importance of molecular differences between 3 types of CRISPR-cas systems. The authors developed a stochastic epidemiological model for this. Outcome would be that type 3 systems could outcompete type 1 and 2. This is because for type 1 and 2 the control of phage evolution is mediated by spacer diversity and there is a diversity critical threshold whereas for type 3 CRISPR-Cas systems, spacer diversity does not impact phage extinction and the epidemiological outcome is driven by the probability to generate at least one resistant genotype. library(tibble) score_table &lt;- tibble(`Transparency criteria` = c(&quot;Study purpose&quot;, &quot;Data availability statement&quot;, &quot;Data location&quot;, &quot;Study location&quot;, &quot;Author review&quot;, &quot;Ethics statement&quot;, &quot;Funding statement&quot;, &quot;Code availability&quot;), Score = c(&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Data location not stated&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;Tier 4&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;) ) knitr::kable(score_table) Transparency criteria Score Study purpose Yes Data availability statement Yes Data location Data location not stated Study location No Author review Tier 4 Ethics statement No Funding statement Yes Code availability Yes For trying to reproduce a figure I’ve decided to use the following article: Title: Monitoring trends and differences in COVID-19 case fatality rates using decomposition methods: Contributions of age structure and age-specific fatality. Authors: Christian Dudel Tim Riffe Enrique Acosta Alyson van Raalte Cosmo Strozza Mikko Myrskylä The code in this paper is showing how the death rate progresses as COVID-19 cases rise per country and New York City In terms of readability of the code, I would grade it a 3 out of 5. This is because the filtering steps are harder to read for me, but the plotting itself is very readable. If I had to scale how easy the plot is to reproduce where 1 is very hard, and 5 is very easy, I’d grade it a 5. This is because the only thing that had to be changed was the path for the inputfile. ### Monitoring trends and differences in COVID-19 case fatality ############## ### rates using decomposition methods: A demographic perspective ############## ### Last updated: 2020-07-22 11:18:52 CEST ### Contact: ### riffe@demogr.mpg.de ### acosta@demogr.mpg.de ### dudel@demogr.mpg.de ### Packages ################################################################## library(tidyverse) library(ggrepel) library(scales) library(here) ### Load data ################################################################# # Load data db_gh &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;Data/inputdata.csv&quot;)) view(db_gh) ### Aggregate data ############################################################ # Filter date db_gh$Date &lt;- as.Date(db_gh$Date,&quot;%d.%m.%y&quot;) db_gh2 &lt;- db_gh %&gt;% filter(Date&lt;=as.Date(&quot;30.06.2020&quot;,&quot;%d.%m.%y&quot;)) # Set New York as &quot;country&quot;

Sarcopenia is the progressive loss of muscle mass, and is often witnessed in older individuals This poses a problem, because there is a significant correlation between the loss of muscle mass and negative outcomes like prolonged hospital stays, increased risk of infections and noninfectious complications, and higher overall mortality rates. (Boirie and Guillet 2018) Sarcopenia has multiple contributing factors. Some of these factors include reduced physical activity, heightened oxidative stress, an inflammatory state, changes in hormonal levels, resistance to muscle-building processes, and inadequate nutrition. (Van Dijk et al. 2016) Older adults require a higher amount of protein in their diet compared to younger ones. This is important for their overall health, aid in recovery from illness, and maintain their physical abilities. As people age, their bodies undergo changes in protein metabolism. To help these older individuals (those that are older than 65 years) maintain body mass and function, it is recommended that their average daily protein per kilogram of body weight per day ranges between 1.0 to 1.2. It is also recommended that older individuals undergo both endurance- and resistance-type exercises at levels that are safe and tolerated. And the one’s that are exercising at a more frequent level should have a protein intake of around 1.2 grams per kilogram body weight per day. (Bauer et al. 2013) Leucine is one of the most important amino acid for protein synthesis. It is a nutritionally essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA). Leucine is one of the most abundant amine acids in high quality protein foods. By activating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and placental cells, leucine increases protein synthesis. Leucine also promotes metabolism of energy (by uptake of glucose, mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation) in order to fulfill the energy needs that are needed for protein synthesis. Furthermore, leucine plays a part in inhibiting protein degradation. Approximately 20% of Leucine is converted to alfa-ketoisocaproate (alfa-KIC) and beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) in skeletal muscle. It has been hypothesized that the functions of these metabolites are responsible for the effects of Leucine on the muscles. That is why these metabolites have also received considerable attention as nutritional supplements. (Duan et al. 2016) Nutricia Research is aware of the effects that Leucine provides in regards to protein synthesis and the inhibition of protein degradation. This is why Nutricia Research is experimenting with adding Leucine to plant based diets to make these diets more viable for protein synthesis. For the projecticum, me and 2 classmates are going to be visualising a complex dataset of amino acid concentrations in mice (plasma) put on different diets. The difficulty of this project stems from the fact that for every experimental group (5 groups) there are multiple mice, where each mice have 21 concentrations of amino acids in plasma. The negative control in this experiment is the group fasted (F) where the mice fasted and amino acids concentrations were measured. The positive control for this experiment is whey (W). These groups are shown in this paper (Dijk et al. 2018) 9.2 References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
